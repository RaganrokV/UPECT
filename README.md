# Universal Pre-trained Energy Consumption Transformer (UPECT)
## UPECT is a large-scale open-source pre-trained model for predicting trip energy consumption. Boosted by 40 million learnable parameters and 300,412 real-world trips, UPECT effectively learns prior knowledge and transferable representations about energy consumption.

# How to use?
## If you are also using data from the Chinese GB32960 technical specification, you can find out how to extract the trips in files 1-5.
